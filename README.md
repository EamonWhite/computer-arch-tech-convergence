The second section is a Linux assignment
Commands to be entered at the Linux terminal on an AWS VM

Q2.1 Write a brief description of what each command does
Q2.2 Group the commands marked with * into a shell script and write the script using the Vim text editor. 
     Add output redirection to append the output to a firstnameSurname.txt file
Q2.3.1 Change the access permissions using the 'chmod' command so that the personal folder is fully accessible to the user (read, write and execute privileges)
       and totally inaccessible to the group and all other users
Q2.3.2 Using the 'lynx' text-based browser programme on the VM search for an online IP location service to determine the city and country where the VM is located,
       type the IP address of the VM to reveal the VM's location
Q2.4 Write a shell script using the Vim text editor that behaves like an Irish person offering a cup of tea:
     - If user types 'y', the programme displays "Great, I'll make tea now!" to the console
     - If user types 'n', the programme asks the user "Are you sure?" 4 more times before giving up
     - If at any point during the 4 follow up offers the user changes their mind and presses 'y', "Great, I'll make tea now!" is printed to the console
In addition to shell scripting, this exercise examines the ability to use 'while loops' and if statements correctly
